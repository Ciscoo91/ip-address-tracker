### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/) - This has amazing examples to show how to customize the marker icon.
- [React example to changer marker icon](https://codewithwolf.com/how-to-change-marker-color-react-leaflet) - This helped me for the icon marker icon on the map. I used also the github code or the react-leaflet dependancy to see if the marker components as an icon prop.
